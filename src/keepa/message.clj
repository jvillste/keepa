(ns keepa.message
  "The functions in this namespace package raw data into PGP _messages_, which
  can be compressed, encrypted, and signed.

  The encryption functions use the concept of _encryptors_ and _decryptors_.
  A collection of encryptors may be used to encipher a message, and any
  corresponding decryptor will be able to decipher it.

  For symmetric encryption, the encryptor is the passphrase string and the
  corresponding decryptor is the same string.

  For public-key encryption, the encryptor is the public-key object and the
  decryptor is the corresponding private-key. Alternately, the decryptor can be
  a function which accepts a key id and returns the corresponding private-key,
  to look it up or unlock the key on demand."
